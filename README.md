# Welcome to My AI/ML Projects Repository! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction
Hello and welcome!
This repository is a collection of my Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects.
Each project here represents a step in my journey exploring the world of machine learning, deep learning, and data science.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a student, or simply curious about AI/ML, I hope you'll find something interesting and insightful in my work!

## About the Projects
In this repository, you'll find various projects covering different AI/ML domains, including:

* Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:
  Preparing and transforming raw data to make it ready for modeling.

* Supervised Learning:
  Building and training models like classification and regression using algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

* Deep Learning:
  Implementing deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.Includes projects like image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

* Unsupervised Learning:
  Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like K-Means, PCA, and t-SNE.

* Model Deployment:
  Demonstrating how to deploy machine learning models using APIs (Flask/FastAPI) and Docker.

* Advanced Topics:
  Experiments with reinforcement learning, generative models (GANs), and transformer architectures.

Each project is organized with clear code, explanations, and usage instructions to make it easy to understand and replicate.
