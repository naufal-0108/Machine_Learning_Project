# 🛰️ Semantic Building Segmentation with Satellite Imagery using Modified U-Net
## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my deep learning project!
This repository contains the implementation of a semantic image segmentation model that identifies and segments buildings from satellite imagery. The model is built using a Modified U-Net Architecture, optimized for high-resolution spatial data and fine-grained building detection.

This project combines powerful convolutional neural network techniques with satellite imagery to support urban planning, disaster response, and geographic information systems (GIS).

## 🧠 Project Highlights
🏙️ Semantic Segmentation of Buildings from overhead satellite images

🔍 Modified U-Net Architecture with enhancements for better edge detection and segmentation accuracy

🛰️ Utilizes real-world satellite datasets (e.g., SpaceNet, Inria Aerial, etc.)

⚙️ Built using PyTorch/TensorFlow (depending on your choice)

📊 Includes metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Coefficient

🧪 Modular training, validation, and inference pipeline

📁 Clean code structure and reproducible results
